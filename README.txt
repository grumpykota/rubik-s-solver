To run the program you open the rubik.sln file in any environment you prefer (the work was done in visual studio 2022) and in the App.cpp file on lines 24 to 27 you make 3 moves to blend the cube (you can change the moves as long as they are allowed, you can find the allowed moves in define.h)

Lines 29 to 46 give an alternative way of initializing the cube where the initial state of the cube is constructed by random moves.
